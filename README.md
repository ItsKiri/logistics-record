# logistics-record

Step 1: Direct to the program on console

Step 2: npm install

Step 3: npm start

Step 4(for cypress test): Open a new console, direct to the program, npm run cypress:open

You could create record with default status: created.

After creating the record, you could update it, cancel it and delete it.

Records with status: delivered could not be canceled.

there are some problems with search function and addNote function.

You need to refresh the page to make the search function work.

And for addNote function, it would need some improvement.

I would finish them in the future.
